so the api has the endpoints for:
generating text.
compare image.
analyze image.

my gh action should act on the file changes,

1. send it to api to compare the commit details.
2. reviews it, suggest improvement
3. find bugs
4. write tests
5. approval/denied action by user should also reflect on the ai response

Hopefully, also format the ai response to allow the separation of files for easier display
