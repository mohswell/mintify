# AI-Integrated Code Pipeline 

This is an innovative AI-powered analysis tool designed to enhance code review and pull request management using cutting-edge AI technologies.

## How It Works: Technical Architecture

### 1. Authentication and Integration
- Users setup the action in their workflows.
- The action requires a `base_app_url` and `api_key` defined in your respository secrets.
- You'll visit the dashboard page at [Bunjy AI](https://bunjy.vercel.app) to generate an `api_key` and copy the `base_app_url`.
- Users can log in using GitHub OAuth to authorize my core service.
- The application connects directly to GitHub repositories via the action workflow.
- Securely retrieves repository and pull request data
- Displays AI reviews for your code changes directly within the PR opened, or in the dahboard [homepage](https://bunjy.vercel.app/home).

### 2. AI Analysis Process
1. When a pull request is opened, the app:
   - Captures code changes
   - Analyzes commit messages
   - Processes repository context
   - Runs AI models (Gemini Nano) to evaluate:
     - Code quality
     - Potential risks
     - Improvement suggestions
     - Reviewer recommendations

### 3. Data Flow

## üõ†Ô∏è What Does This App Do?

This application provides intelligent insights into GitHub pull requests by analyzing:
- Code changes, commit messages, and statistics.
- AI-driven suggestions for PR quality improvements.
- PR risk assessments based on AI analysis.
- Reviewer suggestions and code quality highlights.

## API Keys and Base App URL to use as repository secrets

To use this AI app, you will need to obtain an API keys to authorize the middleware server. Here are the steps to get your API keys:

**Bunjy AI API Key**: 
   - Go to [Bunjy AI app](https://bunjy.vercel.app).
   - On the login page, select continue with github for seamless repository setup.
   - On the homepage, click on access tokens and generate a new API Key variable.
   - Copy the generated token and add it to your environment secrets.

**Base App Url**:
The base URL to use the application to be added in a github action should be copied from the same page where you generate the API key above.

I will soon find a way to use the action without the URL specified, making it more flexible and easier to configure.

### Apps and Packages

- **`web`**: The main user-facing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application for viewing and managing pull request analyses.
- **`api`**: The backend core service powered by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) for interacting with the database and integrating AI services like Gemini.
- **`workflows/scripts`**: This repository includes various shell scripts to automate different tasks:

1. Analyzes files in the repository to gather insights and metrics.
2. Sets up the necessary environment variables required for the application.
3. Sends metadata to the server for further processing and analysis.
4. Processes comments in pull requests to provide feedback and suggestions.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohswell/mintify.git
cd mintify
npm install
```

```bash
npm install turbo --save-dev
```

---

### Environment Variables

Configure environment variables in `.env`, `.env.local`, or `.env.template` for different environments.

#### Root `.env` Example:
```env
DATABASE_URL=""
DIRECT_URL=""
```

#### For the Frontend go to `web` and create a `.env.local` Example:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=""
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=""
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:3000"
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=""
GITHUB_SECRET=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/api/v1"
```

#### For the Backend go to `api` and create a `.env` Example:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=""
GEMINI_PRO_MODEL="gemini-pro"
GEMINI_PRO_VISION_MODEL="gemini-pro-vision"
PORT=8000
JWT_SECRET=""
DATABASE_URL=""
```

### Scripts

Here are the key npm scripts for managing the monorepo:

| Command           | Description                                              |
|-----------------  |----------------------------------------------------------|
| `turbo run build` | Builds all apps and packages.                            |
| `rubo run dev`    | Starts the development servers for all apps.             |
| `turbo run lint`  | Runs ESLint across all apps and packages.                |
| `turbo run format`| Formats code using Prettier.                             |
| `turbo run start` | Starts the whole application in production mode.         |
